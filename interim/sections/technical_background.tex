\section{Overview of GaAs/AlGaAs HEMTs}

In the GaAs/AlGaAs HEMTs used in this project, the interface between the 
GaAs channel layer and the overlying AlGaAs barrier produces a 
discontinuity in the conduction band because the two materials have 
different bandgaps. This offset creates a potential well on the GaAs side 
of the junction. Electrons supplied by silicon donors in the modulation--doped 
AlGaAs layer transfer into this well and accumulate to form the 
2DEG that serves as the conducting channel. This interfacial 2DEG is the 
defining feature of the GaAs/AlGaAs HEMT structure \cite{liu1999}.
